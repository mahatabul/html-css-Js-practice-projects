        Hello friends! I'm Jimmy, a passionate coder. From an early age, I've been fascinated by how technology shapes
        our world, which led me to choose this field with the goal of actively contributing to its future. So far in my
        coding journey, I have learned C, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I'm learning JavaScript and look forward to learning
        more and building more <a href="">projects</a>. If you're also a coding enthusiast, I'd love to connect and
        discuss coding with
        you. You can check my <a href="">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="">Instagram</a>.
